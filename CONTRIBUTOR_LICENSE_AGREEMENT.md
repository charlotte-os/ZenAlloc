2. **Upgradeability:**
   - You acknowledge that the Project administrator has the right to upgrade the Project's licenses to newer versions of the GPL or LGPL at their discretion. You consent to your contributions being licensed under such newer versions if the Project administrator so decides.

3. **Modification to More Restrictive Licenses:**
   - You agree that the Project administrator may modify the licensing terms to a more restrictive copyleft license than the GPL 3.0 or LGPL 3.0 in the future. Such modifications will never result in a license that is less restrictive than the GPL 3.0 or LGPL 3.0.

4. **Contributor Warranty:**
   - You represent that you have the legal right to grant this license for all contributions you submit. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the contributions on behalf of that employer or that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions to the Project.
